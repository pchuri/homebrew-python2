# Homebrew Python2

## How do I install this formula?
```bash
brew tap pchuri/homebrew-python2
brew install python@2
```

## Limitations
As unsupported packages do not have bottles we need to install from
source. This has been tested on macOS 10.13 so far.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
